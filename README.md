# Minimalist Banking Web App

A simple and elegant banking application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Special thanks to @[jonasschmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) for teaching this project in his Udemy course. This project simulates basic banking functionalities including user login, balance tracking, money transfers, loan requests, and account closureâ€”all wrapped in a minimalist design.

## Features

- **User Login**:  
  Log in with a username (automatically generated from your name) and PIN.

  View your current balance, transaction history (movements), and a summary of deposits, withdrawals, and interest.

- **Transactions**:  
  - **Money Transfer**: Send money to other accounts.  
  - **Loan Request**: Request a loan (approved if any deposit is at least 10% of the requested amount).  
  - **Account Closure**: Close your account after confirming your username and PIN.  
  - **Sort Movements**: Toggle to sort your transaction history.

- **Auto Logout Timer**:  
  For security, the app logs out automatically after 5 minutes of inactivity.

- **Dynamic Date and Currency Formatting**:  
  Uses international standards to display dates and currencies in the appropriate format.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: Styles the app using modern design techniques and Google Fonts (Poppins).
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Implements dynamic functionalities, including:
  - Login authentication.
  - Transaction handling (transfers, loans, account closure).
  - Auto logout timer with `setInterval`.
  - Date formatting with `Intl.DateTimeFormat` and currency formatting with `Intl.NumberFormat`.
